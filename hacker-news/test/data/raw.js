What do you do if a company claims to have paid you, shows a screenshot of the transaction, and your own bank claims to have zero knowledge of the transfer?<p>This is a <i>very</i> reputable software company that claims to have paid me $13200 for my work in September, but my bank has no knowledge of any transfer. Meanwhile the other company&#x27;s bank says that the wire transfer was not rejected, so as far as they know this amount is in my account now. I need this money (it&#x27;s what I work for), is there anything I can do before getting a lawyer involved?
